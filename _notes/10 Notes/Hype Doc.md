Despite [[Documenting Meetings]], creating a [[Design Decision Log]], [[Save Screenshots]], and having a clear [[How I use Bullet Journal]] method, I often draw a blank during yearly reviews. The Hype Doc solves this issue. It's an ever-growing note on small wins, accomplishments, and aspirations.

The Hype Doc can include learnings, skill improvements, direct and indirect projects you worked or collaborated, your teams achievements, compliments on your team members, events, screenshots. Just keep collecting it. [[Save Screenshots]]. 

For work, I add links to an empty file called **HypeDoc** in my [LogSeq](https://logseq.com/) daily log. (Read [[Documenting Meetings]]). For personal projects, I use a simple markdown file in my Obsidian vault to record the date, details, and links.

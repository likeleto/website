Every task gets done because people work together. When someone praises your work, share how your team helped make it happen. Name the people who gave ideas, solved problems, or supported you. Write their names in presentations and reports. Send notes to their managers about their good work. Thank them clearly and often.

When you openly appreciate others, work becomes more enjoyable. People trust each other more. Good leaders shine light on others. When you help others be seen, the whole team grows stronger. You build trust that lasts beyond any single project. Start today.

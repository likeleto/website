In my creative process, I often gravitate towards physical, hands-on methods without relying on digital tools. I find tangible tools provide a unique perspective and ease during ideation that digital alternatives can't always match.

- For instance, when my partner and I planned our apartment renovation, we spent 90 minutes with paper and pen. This analog approach led to faster decision-making than scrolling through Pinterest boards. 
- Similarly, when discussing MVPs and new products with founders, I prefer sitting down with just paper and pen – no slides, websites, or competitor references. This approach not only helps me gauge whether they're visual thinkers or visualisers but also ensures we're literally "on the same page" while ideating. [[Visual Thinkers vs. Visualisers]].
